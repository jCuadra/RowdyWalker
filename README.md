# RowdyWalker
MATLAB simulation of a passive dynamic walker based on the UTSA mascot, the Rowdy

Video files:

(1) A video of 3D printing of the toy is on YouTube (46 secs long): https://youtu.be/sAGWg-DyDOw

(2) A video of the match between simulation and animation is on YouTube (17 secs long): https://youtu.be/sAGWg-DyDOw 

The MATLAB files in this repository may be used to create the animation as shown in video (2) above. 

All files may be run using MATLAB
(1) RowdyWalkerSim - creates a simulation of the toy

(2) derive1DOF_front_stance_Sec3_1.m, derive2DOF_rear_stance_Sec3_3_Sec3_4.m, derive1DOF_rear_stance_Sec3_5.m, and derive2DOF_front_stance_Sec3_7_Sec3_8.m - used to derive the equations of motion that are then placed in the RowdyWalkerSim file.

(3) Equations_ReadMe.pdf -- This explains how the equations of motion were derived.
